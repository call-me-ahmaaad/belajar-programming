        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/Bismarck Party.webp" alt="KMS Bismarck" width="450"></div>
        <p>
            The Bismarck class was a pair of fast battleships built for Germany's Kriegsmarine shortly before the
            outbreak of World War II. The ships were the largest and most powerful warships built for the Kriegsmarine;
            displacing more than 41,000 metric tons (40,000 long tons) normally, they were armed with a battery of eight
            38 cm (15 in) guns and were capable of a top speed of 30 knots (56 km/h; 35 mph). Bismarck was laid down in
            July 1936 and completed in September 1940, while her sister Tirpitz's keel was laid in October 1936 and work
            finished in February 1941. The ships were ordered in response to the French Richelieu-class battleships and
            they were designed with the traditional role of engaging enemy battleships in home waters in mind, though
            the German naval command envisioned employing the ships as long-range commerce raiders against British
            shipping in the Atlantic Ocean. As such, their design represented strategic confusion that dominated German
            naval construction in the 1930s.

            Both ships had short service careers. Bismarck conducted only one operation, Operation Rheinübung, a sortie
            into the North Atlantic to raid supply convoys sent from North America to Great Britain. During the
            operation, she destroyed the British battlecruiser HMS Hood and damaged the new battleship Prince of Wales
            in the Battle of the Denmark Strait. Bismarck was defeated and sunk in a final engagement after a three-day
            chase by the Royal Navy. Disagreements over the cause of the sinking persist with chiefly British sources
            claiming responsibility for the sinking of the ship. Evidence reviewed by Robert Ballard and James Cameron
            indicates that her loss was most likely due to scuttling as originally claimed by her surviving
            crew-members.

            Tirpitz's career was less dramatic; she operated in the Baltic Sea briefly in 1941 before being sent to
            Norwegian waters in 1942, where she acted as a fleet in being, threatening the convoys from Britain to the
            Soviet Union. She was repeatedly attacked by the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force between 1942 and 1944, but
            she was not seriously damaged in these attacks. In 1944, Lancaster bombers hit the ship with two Tallboy
            bombs, which caused extensive internal damage and capsized the battleship. Tirpitz was broken up for scrap
            between 1948 and 1957
