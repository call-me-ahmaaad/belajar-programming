        I see you, you see me
        How pleasant, this feeling
        The moment you hold me
        I missed you, I'm sorry
        I've given what I have
        I showed you I'm growing
        The ashes fall slowly
        As your voice consoles me
            
        <b>[Chorus]</b>
        As the hours pass
        I will let you know
        That I need to ask
        Before I'm alone
        How it feels to rest
        On your patient lips
        To eternal bliss
        I'm so glad to know
        As the hours pass
        I will let you know
        That I need to ask
        Before I'm alone
        How it feels to rest
        On your patient lips
        To eternal bliss
        I'm so glad to know

        <b>[Verse 2]</b>
        We're swaying to drum beats
        In motion, I'm feeling
        My patience controlling
        The question, I won't speak
        We're telling the stories
        Our laughter, he knows me
        We're leaving, we're talking
        You're closer, it's calming

        <b>[Chorus]</b>
        As the hours pass
        I will let you know
        That I need to ask
        Before I'm alone
        How it feels to rest
        On your patient lips
        To eternal bliss
        I'm so glad to know
        As the hours pass
        I will let you know
        That I need to ask
        Before I'm alone
        How it feels to rest
        On your patient lips
        To eternal bliss
        I'm so glad to know

        <b>[Bridge]</b>
        The night will hold us close, and the stars will guide us home
        I've been waiting for this moment, we're finally alone
        I turn to ask the question, so anxious, my thoughts
        Your lips were soft like winter, in your passion, I was lost

        <b>[Chorus]</b>
        As the hours pass
        I will let you know
        That I need to ask
        Before I'm alone
        How it feels to rest
        On your patient lips
        To eternal bliss
        I'm so glad to know
        As the hours pass
        I will let you know
        That I need to ask
        Before I'm alone
        How it feels to rest
        On your patient lips
        To eternal bliss
        I'm so glad to know
        As the hours pass
        I will let you know
        That I need to ask
        Before I'm alone
        How it feels to rest
        On your patient lips
        To eternal bliss
        I'm so glad to know
        As the hours pass
        I will let you know
        That I need to ask
        Before I'm alone
        How it feels to rest
        On your patient lips
        To eternal bliss
        I'm so glad to know
